# homework1 Horiseon assignment

## Description

In this project I refactored the code to meet the standards set by the README. To do this I started by giving the website a proper title. I created separate sections for each section to fix the issues of them overlapping. I also had to move the aside above the sections for the aside bar to move up to it's proper positioning. I also adjusted the aside CSS by removing width and adding text-align:center to have the elements align properly in the aside bar. I believe I also adjusted margin to get the text to line up better in aside but I don't remember. 

Made sure the links to the sections worked by making sure each ID was being called correctly. 
Realigned all of the html elements to follow semantic rules.
